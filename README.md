# Machine-learning in Python

This repository is my personal playground for experimenting with AI and machine learning using Python.  
Here I test new ideas, explore libraries, and learn by building small projects and prototypes.

## Contents
- Python scripts for AI experiments
- Jupyter notebooks with ML demos
- Notes and quick experiments with AI models
